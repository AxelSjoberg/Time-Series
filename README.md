# Time-Series
Repo for the course Time Series Analysis - FMSN45 at LTH


## Lab 1
This computer exercise treats identification, estimation, and model validation
in ARMA- and SARIMA-processes. Your goal is to be proficient in simulating
different kinds of stationary and non-stationary time series, and to master the
’craft’ of identification and modeling of such. You will use the autocorrelation
function (ACF), the partial autocorrelation function (PACF), probability plots
and different parameter estimators as your basic toolkit. In this exercise, you
will use these on both simulated and measured time series data.

## Lab 2

In this computer exercise, you will work with input-output relations, as well as
prediction in time series models. Firstly, you will be acquainted with time
series having an exogenous input, having to analyze the impulse respons of
such a system and from it build a suitable model. Secondly, this computer
exercise deals with prediction, perhaps the most important application of time
series modeling. You will be expected to make predictions of all models
introduced in this course, i.e., up to a SARIMAX model.

## Lab 3

This computer exercise treats recursive parameter estimation using Kalman
filtering and recursive least squares. We attempt to model dynamic systems of
both the SARIMA-type, having time-varying A and C polynomials, as well as
to allow for ARMAX processes which have a synthetic input signal and
time-varying B polynomial.

## Project

Using a dataset containing the hourly measurments from a weather station just 
outside copenhagen, a stationary ARMA model and ARMAX model with the puropse 
of temperature prediction were fitted. Moreover a recursive parameter estimation
method was applied using Kalman filtering for temperature prediction.
